A tangible user interface (TUI) is a user interface in which a person interacts with digital information through the physical environment.

Linux is one of the most popular operating systems and is a common choice for developers. However, it is difficult to remember the vast range of commands that Linux supports, and hence a Python program that can run these commands easily is demonstrated below. 

In this article, we will deal with a Python program that can be used to run complex Linux commands. This program is a drop-down menu that gives the user a choice list and the user can proceed with his/her required option. Python has an OS module that can be used to run or execute Linux commands. The os module helps interact with the Operating System.

Here are the functionalities implemented in this program:

Displaying the current date.
Displaying the calendar.
Configuring the web.
Configuring docker.
Adding a user.
launching a virtual machine.
Deleting a user.
Creating a file.
Creating a folder.
 
The application must be run on a Linux terminal.
